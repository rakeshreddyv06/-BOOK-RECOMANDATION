# Stakeholder Register Submission

Stakeholder Register Submission

The stakeholder register is a formally documented record that identifies all stakeholders involved in the Book Recommendation System project. It includes details such as stakeholder names, roles, level of interest, level of influence, expectations, and communication requirements. This register helps the project team clearly understand who is affected by the project and how each stakeholder contributes to or influences its success. By maintaining a structured stakeholder register, the team ensures effective communication, proper expectation management, and timely involvement of stakeholders during critical project phases. The completed stakeholder register has been submitted for review to validate stakeholder identification and ensure alignment with academic and project objectives.
