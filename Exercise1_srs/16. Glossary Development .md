# Project Charter

The Project Charter formally defines the Book Recommendation System project and serves as an initial authorization document for its development. It outlines the project objectives, which focus on building an AI-based system that provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their preferences, reading history, and ratings. The charter clearly defines the project scope by identifying included features such as book search, recommendation generation, user profiles, and admin management, while also specifying out-of-scope items to avoid scope creep. It identifies key stakeholders including users, developers, instructors, and the university, along with their roles and responsibilities. The document also highlights potential risks such as data quality issues, model accuracy limitations, and time constraints, along with basic mitigation strategies. Additionally, it establishes high-level milestones and deliverables, ensuring structured planning, clear direction, and alignment with academic and project goals throughout the development lifecycle.
