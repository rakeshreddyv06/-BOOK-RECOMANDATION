# Stakeholder Interests

The primary stakeholders of the Book Recommendation System include users, instructors, developers, and the university. Users have a high level of interest and influence, as they expect accurate, personalized, and relevant book recommendations to improve their reading experience. Instructors play a key role by ensuring the academic quality, correctness of documentation, and successful completion of the project according to course objectives. Developers have a medium level of interest and influence, gaining practical experience in software engineering, machine learning, and collaborative development while building the system. The university also holds a medium level of influence, with an interest in the successful execution of the project, academic outcomes, and maintaining educational standards.
