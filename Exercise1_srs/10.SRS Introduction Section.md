# SRS Introduction

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of the Book Recommendation System. It serves as a reference for developers, instructors, and stakeholders to understand system behavior, constraints, and expectations. The scope of the system includes an AI-based recommendation platform that suggests books based on user preferences, ratings, and reading history. This document also outlines system features, user interactions, and performance requirements to ensure clarity and consistency during development. Common terms and abbreviations such as CF (Collaborative Filtering) and CBF (Content-Based Filtering) are defined to avoid ambiguity and improve understanding.
