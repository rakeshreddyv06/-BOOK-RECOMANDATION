# Scope Boundaries

The system focuses only on recommending books using stored datasets and does not handle physical book delivery or third-party sales. It is limited to providing recommendations based on user preferences, ratings, and available book metadata. External payment processing, real-time inventory management, and integration with commercial e-commerce platforms are outside the scope of this project. The system is intended for educational and research purposes and is designed to demonstrate recommendation techniques rather than serve as a full-scale commercial application.
