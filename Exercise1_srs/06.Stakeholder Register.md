# Stakeholder Register

A formal stakeholder register is maintained to document key stakeholders involved in the project, including their names, roles, level of interest, influence on the project, and communication requirements. This register helps ensure clear communication, proper expectation management, and active involvement of stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle. By identifying stakeholder priorities and influence early, the team can make informed decisions, reduce risks, and ensure the project aligns with both academic and user expectations.
