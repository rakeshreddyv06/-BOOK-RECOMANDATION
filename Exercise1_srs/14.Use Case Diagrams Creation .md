# Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams are created to visually represent the interactions between users and the Book Recommendation System. The diagrams identify two main actors: User and Admin. Users can register, log in, search for books, view book details, receive personalized recommendations, and provide ratings or feedback. Admins are responsible for managing the book catalog, updating book information, and maintaining user data. These diagrams help in clearly understanding system functionality, user responsibilities, and the overall system workflow, making them useful for both development and documentation purposes.
